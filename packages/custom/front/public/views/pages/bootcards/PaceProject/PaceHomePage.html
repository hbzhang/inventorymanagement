                This tool allows faculty and supervisors to plan annual performance and professional development goals.
                It uses ACPA/NASPA competencies and industry-specific competencies related to the faculty member’s field of expertise.
                Additional faculty performance management resources are available at the DSA HR SharePoint site,
                which can be accessed from the departments’ navigation on Your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.your.dsa.vt.edu/">DSA Home</a>.
                The following are the phases for completing what is referred to as the PACE process.

                    <strong>Planning</strong>
                    The shaded portions of Sections A, B, and C are completed by the faculty member at the
                    beginning of the performance cycle to establish goals and professional development plans.
                    (Note: For new faculty, this should be completed approximately 30 days after their start date.)
                    Goals should support departmental and Division of Student Affairs’ strategic goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Affirmation</strong>
                    The faculty member and the faculty member’s supervisor meet to review the performance plan and negotiate any
                    changes, expectations, and/or
                    resources needed to achieve the plan in Sections A, B, and C. Signatures should be completed in Section D.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication</strong>
                    The faculty member and their supervisor should maintain communication regarding the progress and/or needed
                    changes to performance goals and the professional development plan throughout the year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Evaluation</strong>
                    This phase is completed in five steps at the end of the performance cycle and includes an overall
                    review of the faculty member’s accomplishments and progress towards the selected goals.

                       The faculty member completes the self-evaluation in the un-shaded blocks with an asterisk (*) of Sections A, B, C, and E.
                        The faculty member then passes the self-evaluation to the faculty member’s supervisor.

                    <li>
                        The supervisor reviews the self-evaluation and makes comments on Sections A, B, C, and E.
                        The supervisor then schedules a meeting with the faculty member to discuss the evaluation.

                    <li>
                        The faculty member and supervisor review Sections A, B, C, and E and then complete Sections F and G together during the meeting.
                        The supervisor then passes the completed evaluation to the supervisor’s supervisor (the reviewer) for review.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reviewer examines Section A, B, C, E, and F, makes comments in Section E, and signs in Section G.
                        The reviewer then passes the completed evaluation back to the supervisor.

                    <li>
                        The supervisor notifies DSA Human Resources of the overall performance rating and files the evaluation tool in the department’s personnel file.
